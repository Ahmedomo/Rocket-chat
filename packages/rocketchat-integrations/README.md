# To Do List
If you're reading this, feel free to submit a pull request to implement any of these. :wink:

* Create setting to allow outgoing chat integration with trigger words to have the words be anywhere in a message
* Store history of ran outgoing webhooks and what triggered them with a replay option
* Create a setting which exposes the number of times an integration is triggered
* Explain how the calculation of the rerun interval is calculated
* Collect stats on the integrations - how many are installed, enabled, have scripts enabled, and how many time one runs successfully
